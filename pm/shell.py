"""pm.shell(): the one place Hermes resolves the shell it runs commands with.

Callers that need bash (the terminal backend, `_find_bash`) call this instead
of hunting fixed locations.

Resolution order:
  1. Provisioned PATH: shutil.which("bash") — the store dirs are on the
     process PATH after pm.activate() ran.
  2. Fallback table for non-bundle / daemon-launch PATH edge cases
     (/usr/bin/bash, /bin/bash, $SHELL, /bin/sh). A systemd/cron-launched
     gateway may have a minimal PATH and macOS /bin/bash is not on PATH by
     default, so `which` alone is not enough there.
